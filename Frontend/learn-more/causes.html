  <h1>Causes, Diagnosis and Symptoms</h1>

  <section id="causes">
    <h2>Causes of PCOS</h2>
    <p>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) develops when the ovaries produce excessive amounts of androgens — male hormones present in both men and women but usually in small amounts in females. This hormonal imbalance can interfere with the normal development and release of eggs during the menstrual cycle.
    </p>
    <h3>Key contributing factors:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Insulin resistance:</strong> When cells don’t respond properly to insulin, the body produces more of it, which can increase androgen production.</li>
      <li><strong>Hormonal imbalance:</strong> Higher levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) or lower levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) can disrupt ovulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> PCOS often runs in families, suggesting a hereditary link.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-grade inflammation:</strong> Women with PCOS may have low-grade inflammation that stimulates cyst formation.</li>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle and environmental factors:</strong> Unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, and high stress may worsen symptoms.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="symptoms">
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Symptoms can vary greatly depending on the specific condition. Common signs to watch for include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes in menstrual cycle patterns (irregular or missed periods)</li>
      <li>Persistent pelvic pain or discomfort</li>
      <li>Unexplained weight gain or loss</li>
      <li>Skin changes such as acne or dark patches</li>
      <li>Fatigue and mood fluctuations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not all symptoms indicate a serious condition; however, if they persist or worsen, a medical consultation is advised.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="diagnosis">
    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
   
    <p>There is no single test for PCOS; doctors usually confirm it based on a combination of symptoms, blood tests, and imaging.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Medical history review:</strong> Discussing menstrual cycle patterns, weight changes, skin problems, and family history of PCOS or diabetes.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical examination:</strong> Checking for excess hair growth, acne, and other signs of high androgen levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Blood tests:</strong> Measuring hormone levels (LH, FSH, testosterone, insulin, thyroid function) to rule out other causes.</li>
      <li><strong>Pelvic ultrasound:</strong> Imaging to check if ovaries have multiple small cysts and to assess the thickness of the uterine lining.</li>
      <li><strong>Exclusion of other conditions:</strong> Such as thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia, or congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Accurate diagnosis is essential for designing an effective treatment plan tailored to the patient’s needs.</p>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q1: Difference between PCOS, PCOD, and PCO</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p><strong>PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)</strong> is a complex hormonal and metabolic disorder in which the ovaries produce higher-than-normal levels of androgens (male hormones). This can disrupt ovulation, cause irregular menstrual cycles, and lead to symptoms such as acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and infertility. PCOS often involves systemic effects, including insulin resistance and an increased risk of metabolic conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>PCOD (Polycystic Ovary Disease)</strong> is a condition where the ovaries develop multiple immature or partially mature eggs, which can turn into small cysts. This is often due to hormonal imbalances and lifestyle factors. PCOD is generally considered less severe than PCOS, and many women with PCOD can regulate their cycles and conceive with lifestyle modifications.</p>
        <p><strong>PCO (Polycystic Ovaries)</strong> refers only to the ultrasound finding of ovaries containing multiple small cysts or follicles. PCO on its own is not necessarily a disorder — it can be a normal variation in some women. However, PCO may also be seen in women with PCOD or PCOS. The presence of PCO alone does not mean a woman has PCOS unless it is accompanied by other symptoms such as hormonal imbalances or irregular cycles.</p>
        <p><em>In summary:</em> PCO is an ovarian appearance, PCOD is an ovarian condition, and PCOS is a broader syndrome affecting the body’s hormonal and metabolic systems. All women with PCOS will have polycystic ovaries, but not all women with polycystic ovaries have PCOS.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q2: Are all menstrual irregularities a sign of a serious problem?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Not necessarily. Menstrual changes can occur due to stress, dietary habits, or temporary hormonal fluctuations. However, prolonged irregularities should be discussed with a healthcare provider.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q3: Can lifestyle changes help in managing symptoms?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Yes. Maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management can significantly improve symptoms and overall well-being.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q4: How often should I undergo routine check-ups?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>It is generally recommended to have a gynecological check-up at least once a year, or more frequently if symptoms persist or worsen.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q5: What are the signs of PCOD?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>PCOD symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, weight gain, acne, excessive hair growth, mood swings, and sometimes difficulty conceiving. These symptoms are often milder than PCOS and can improve with lifestyle changes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q6: How is PCOD different from PCOS?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>While PCOD primarily refers to an ovarian condition with cyst formation and some hormonal imbalance, PCOS is a wider syndrome involving systemic hormonal and metabolic effects. PCOS usually has more severe symptoms, including higher risks of insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular issues. PCOD can often be managed effectively with lifestyle modifications and is generally less severe than PCOS.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q7: What are the signs of PCOS?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>PCOS symptoms vary from person to person, but common signs include irregular or missed periods, excessive hair growth on the face or body (hirsutism), acne or oily skin, weight gain (especially around the abdomen), thinning scalp hair, and difficulty getting pregnant. Some women may also experience mood changes and darkened skin patches, particularly around the neck or underarms.</p>
