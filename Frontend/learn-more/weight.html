  <section id="weight-basics">
    <h2>Understanding Body Weight</h2>
    <p>Body weight is a key indicator of overall health, influenced by a balance of energy intake and expenditure. Understanding the factors that affect weight can guide effective management strategies.</p>
    
    <h3>Factors Influencing Weight:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Caloric balance:</strong> Weight is determined by calories consumed versus calories burned through metabolism and physical activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Metabolism:</strong> Basal metabolic rate (BMR) varies by age, sex, muscle mass, and genetics, affecting weight maintenance.</li>
      <li><strong>Hormones:</strong> Hormones like insulin, cortisol, and thyroid hormones regulate appetite, fat storage, and energy use.</li>
      <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Genetic predispositions influence body composition and fat distribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress levels significantly impact weight stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Body Composition:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fat mass:</strong> Adipose tissue stores energy and influences metabolic health.</li>
      <li><strong>Lean mass:</strong> Muscles, bones, and organs contribute to higher metabolic rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Water weight:</strong> Fluid retention can cause temporary weight fluctuations.</li>
      <li><strong>Visceral vs. subcutaneous fat:</strong> Visceral fat around organs poses greater health risks than subcutaneous fat under the skin.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="hormonal-weight">
    <h2>Hormonal Effects on Weight Management</h2>
    <p>Hormonal imbalances can significantly impact body weight, particularly in women, due to fluctuations across life stages and conditions like PCOS.</p>
    
    <h3>PCOS and Weight Challenges:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Insulin resistance:</strong> Increases fat storage and appetite, making weight loss difficult.</li>
      <li><strong>Elevated androgens:</strong> Promote visceral fat accumulation, particularly in the abdominal area.</li>
      <li><strong>Appetite dysregulation:</strong> Hormonal imbalances disrupt hunger and satiety signals.</li>
      <li><strong>Metabolic slowdown:</strong> Reduced insulin sensitivity lowers metabolic efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Chronic inflammation linked to PCOS can exacerbate weight gain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Menstrual Cycle Weight Fluctuations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Water retention:</strong> Progesterone in the luteal phase causes bloating and temporary weight gain.</li>
      <li><strong>Appetite changes:</strong> Hormonal shifts increase cravings for high-calorie foods premenstrually.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy expenditure:</strong> Metabolic rate may slightly increase during the follicular phase.</li>
      <li><strong>Mood effects:</strong> Emotional changes can lead to stress eating or reduced physical activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Life Stage Hormonal Changes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Puberty:</strong> Hormonal surges increase fat deposition, especially in females.</li>
      <li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Weight gain is necessary for fetal development but varies widely.</li>
      <li><strong>Postpartum:</strong> Retained weight and hormonal shifts complicate weight loss.</li>
      <li><strong>Menopause:</strong> Decreased estrogen slows metabolism and increases visceral fat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q1: How does PCOS affect weight management?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>PCOS increases insulin resistance and androgen levels, promoting fat storage, especially visceral fat, and increasing appetite. These factors make weight loss harder, but a low-glycemic diet, exercise, and medications like metformin can help improve insulin sensitivity and support weight loss.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q2: Why do I gain weight before my period?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Hormonal fluctuations, particularly rising progesterone in the luteal phase, cause water retention and increased appetite, leading to temporary weight gain of 1-5 pounds. This typically resolves post-menstruation with proper hydration and balanced nutrition.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q3: What's the difference between visceral and subcutaneous fat?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Visceral fat surrounds internal organs and is linked to higher health risks like diabetes and heart disease. Subcutaneous fat lies under the skin, is less harmful, and is more visible. Both can be reduced through diet and exercise, but visceral fat responds better to lifestyle changes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q4: How often should I monitor my weight?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Weigh yourself weekly under consistent conditions (same time, scale, and clothing) to track trends. Daily fluctuations are normal due to water retention. For high-risk individuals (e.g., those with diabetes or PCOS), monthly medical check-ups may be needed to assess progress.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q5: Can diet really affect my weight?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Yes, diet is a primary driver of weight. High-calorie, processed foods promote weight gain, while nutrient-dense, low-glycemic foods like vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains support weight loss and maintenance. Proper hydration and portion control are also critical.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q6: Why do I gain weight during stressful times?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Stress increases cortisol, which stimulates appetite and promotes fat storage, especially in the abdomen. Stress may also lead to emotional eating or reduced physical activity. Managing stress through mindfulness, exercise, or therapy can help regulate weight.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q7: When should I seek professional help for weight management?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Consult a healthcare provider if weight loss stalls despite consistent efforts for 2-3 months, if you have obesity-related conditions (e.g., diabetes, PCOS), or if rapid weight changes cause health issues. Professionals can offer tailored plans or medical interventions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q8: How do hormonal contraceptives affect weight?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Some hormonal contraceptives, especially progestin-only methods, may cause slight weight gain (1-5 pounds) due to fluid retention or appetite changes. Others, like combined oral contraceptives, may have minimal impact. Discuss options with your doctor to find the best fit.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q9: What diet is best for weight loss?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>A balanced, calorie-controlled diet with lean proteins, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats works best. Low-glycemic or Mediterranean diets are effective for sustainable weight loss. Consult a dietitian to personalize based on your health needs and preferences.</p>
