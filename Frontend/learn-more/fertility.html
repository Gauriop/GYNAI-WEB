  <h1>Comprehensive Fertility Management</h1>

  <section id="causes">
    <h2>Causes of Fertility Problems</h2>
    <p>Fertility issues can arise from a variety of factors affecting both men and women. Understanding these causes helps in effective management and treatment planning.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Female factors:</strong> Hormonal imbalances, ovulation disorders, fallopian tube blockages, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, age-related fertility decline, premature ovarian failure.</li>
      <li><strong>Male factors:</strong> Low sperm count (oligospermia), poor sperm motility (asthenospermia), abnormal sperm morphology, structural problems like varicocele, hormonal issues, genetic conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle factors:</strong> Smoking, excessive alcohol use, obesity, chronic stress, poor nutrition, exposure to environmental toxins, sedentary lifestyle.</li>
      <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Diabetes, thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases, sexually transmitted infections.</li>
      <li><strong>Unexplained infertility:</strong> Approximately 10-15% of couples have no identifiable cause despite comprehensive evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="pcos-fertility">
    <h2>PCOS and Fertility</h2>
    <p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of female infertility, affecting 6-12% of women of reproductive age.</p>
    
    <h3>How PCOS Affects Fertility:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Irregular ovulation:</strong> PCOS disrupts normal ovulation cycles, making it difficult to predict fertile days</li>
      <li><strong>Hormonal imbalances:</strong> Elevated androgens and insulin resistance interfere with egg development</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple cysts:</strong> Small cysts on ovaries prevent proper egg release</li>
      <li><strong>Metabolic issues:</strong> Insulin resistance can worsen fertility problems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PCOS Fertility Management:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle modifications:</strong> Weight management, regular exercise, balanced diet low in refined carbohydrates</li>
      <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Metformin for insulin resistance, Clomiphene citrate or Letrozole for ovulation induction</li>
      <li><strong>Ovulation monitoring:</strong> Tracking cycles with ultrasound and hormone testing</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced treatments:</strong> IUI or IVF if other methods are unsuccessful</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="pregnancy-preparation">
    <h2>Preparing for Pregnancy</h2>
    <p>Preconception care is crucial for optimizing fertility and ensuring a healthy pregnancy. Both partners should begin preparation at least 3-6 months before attempting conception.</p>
    
    <h3>For Women:</h3>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q1: How long should we try to conceive before seeking help?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Most couples should seek fertility evaluation after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse without conception. Women over 35 years of age are advised to seek help after 6 months due to age-related fertility decline. Those with known risk factors should consider earlier evaluation.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q2: Can lifestyle changes significantly improve fertility?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Yes, lifestyle modifications can dramatically improve fertility outcomes. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, managing stress, and avoiding environmental toxins can all enhance fertility in both men and women.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q3: How does age affect fertility for both men and women?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Female fertility declines gradually after age 30 and more rapidly after 35, with significant decline after 40 due to decreased egg quality and quantity. Male fertility also declines with age, though more gradually, with decreased sperm quality and increased DNA fragmentation after age 40.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q4: What is the success rate of IVF?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>IVF success rates vary by age, diagnosis, and clinic. For women under 35, success rates per cycle are typically 40-50%. Success rates decrease with age: 35-37 years (30-40%), 38-40 years (20-30%), and over 40 years (10-20%). Multiple cycles may be needed to achieve pregnancy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q5: Is PCOS a major cause of infertility?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Yes, PCOS is one of the leading causes of female infertility, affecting 6-12% of reproductive-aged women. It causes irregular ovulation or anovulation. However, with proper treatment including lifestyle changes, ovulation-inducing medications, and assisted reproductive techniques, most women with PCOS can achieve pregnancy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q6: When is surgery recommended for fertility treatment?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Surgery may be recommended for structural problems such as blocked fallopian tubes, large uterine fibroids, severe endometriosis, uterine septum, or male conditions like varicocele. The decision depends on the specific condition, age, other fertility factors, and whether less invasive treatments have been unsuccessful.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-question">Q7: How important is male partner evaluation in fertility treatment?</div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">
        <p>Male factor infertility contributes to approximately 40-50% of infertility cases. It's essential that both partners undergo evaluation simultaneously. Male fertility assessment is straightforward, typically starting with semen analysis, and can identify treatable conditions that significantly impact conception success.</p>
